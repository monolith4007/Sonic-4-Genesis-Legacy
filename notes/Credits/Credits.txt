"Sonic 4 Genesis" uses a stripped-down version of the Sonic Studio Engine template, and features various modifications which primarily come from the aforementioned templates.

The code for resizing the game window, and the player's homing attack ability, originate from this template, the latter of which has been heavily modified.

The method of storing the animation frames for the player's invincibility effect originates from this template.
